  <p>This is a project that I did in the Web Design Academy. It was a project that was suited for a playing music. I
    chose to do a song project because I like to listen to music and I like to make a website that is about a song that
    I like.</p>

  <p>This project definetly was my favorite because it was a text adventure game. Not made in HTML, made with Python.
    Type in a choice and the game displays your choice and consenquences it may of had.</p>

  <p>This is another Text adventure based game but this time in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Instead of typing your
    choice, you get to click on buttons to continue the story. This was fairly challenging.</p>

  <p>A mini quiz that determines what devil hybrid you are. Mainly based off of Buzzfeed, the quiz that I chose was from
    a popular anime, "Chainsaw Man". Enter your birthday and just chose a side and boom, it'll determine what hybrid you
    are</p>

  <p>The wireframe to the music player. Looks a lot like Spotify but it has a few changes in it. Unfortunately, with
    time running low, my partner -Matthew N- settled on something much more simpler</p>
